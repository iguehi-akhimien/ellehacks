## About:
Meet the AI Angels Team!
Weâ€™re the AI Angels team, and weâ€™ve built ElderEaseâ€”a web application designed to help elderly individuals navigate technology with ease. Picture this: an elderly person wants to record a video on Snapchat but doesnâ€™t have their grandchildren around to guide them. Instead of feeling stuck, they can open ElderEase, where tech support is simple, intuitive, and always available.

### Technology Behind ElderEase
To bring ElderEase to life, we used:

#### Frontend: 
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
#### Backend: 
Python, Flask, and GenAI APIs (Google Gemini and PlayHT)

### Key Features
ElderEase offers a range of functionalities tailored to our audience:
1. Speech-to-text conversation â€“ Simply speak, and the app transcribes it.
2. Text-to-text conversation â€“ Type out questions and get clear, step-by-step guidance.
3. Real-time support â€“ Immediate assistance when itâ€™s needed most.
4. Video search â€“ Easily find tutorial videos on common tech tasks.
5. Integrated text-to-speech responses â€“ Hear answers read aloud for added accessibility.

### Designed for Simplicity
We kept ElderEase clean, legible, and intuitive, ensuring a stress-free experience for seniors. Every button, font, and feature was designed to be easy to use, so technology feels like a helping hand rather than a hurdle.

__With ElderEase, navigating the digital world is simpler than ever! ðŸŒŸ__
